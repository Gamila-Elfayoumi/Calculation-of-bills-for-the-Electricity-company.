# Calculation-of-bills-for-the-Electricity-company.
	This Python program use functions that calculates bills for the Electricity company. There are three types of customers:
	 I. Residential (code R) 
	II. Commercial (code C) 
	III. Industrial (code I). 
	o for a code R customer, the bill is $10 plus $0.05 for each kilowatt used. 
	o For a code C customer, the bill is $1000 for the first 2000 kilowatt, and $0.005 for each additional kilowatt used. 
	o For a code I customer, the bill is $1000 if he used less than 4000 kilowatts, $2000 if he used between 4000 and 10000 kilowatts, or $3000 if he used more than 10000 kilowatts. 
	o The inputs of the program should be the type of customer (R, C, or I) and the kilowatts used. The output should be the amount of money the customer has to pay.
